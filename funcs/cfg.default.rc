# that includes a username and password for HTTP basic auth, or a
# base URL that bypasses the authentification.
#
# An example for the latter approach is the docker-compose example
# project in the documentation for `anno-server-22`. It uses the
# `DOCKER_DOIBOT_CFG_OVERRIDES` line below to override this setting
# with a URL based on the anno server's service name, which can be
# used as a hostname inside the docker-compose network. This direct
# access allows the DOI bot to use any username header unchallenged.
